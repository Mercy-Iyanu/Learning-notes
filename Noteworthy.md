Improving a codebase

1. I am developing a template for our pull request, in an attempt to improve our codebase and the process of reviewing a new change.
A pull request should be documentation where you explain the context of your changes to your colleagues, not explaining the code, but explaining the business logic behind this change, why are you doing this work?
